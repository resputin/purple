This is a guitar and bass pedal VST written in C++ for a class at UCSD. It has tremolo, distortion, overdrive, and stereo widening. Most of this project was prototyped in Pure Data and then implemented using JUCE. The first overdrive algorithm is from my professor at UCSD, Tom Erbe and the second algorithm is from Charles Dodgeâ€™s Computer Music book. The tremolo algorithm was built by me and the stereo widening was also from Tom Erbe. This effect is good for light overdrive with a low input volume and starts to destroy audio when the input gain is increased.
